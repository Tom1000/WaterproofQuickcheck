        \nUse this app to detect if your phone is sealed.
        \nAttention: This has been tested on a Sony Xperia Z3 and Z3 Compact only. In any case, use at your own risk. There is no way to safely detect if your phone is water proof. Instead, this app detects if there are specific pressure fluctuations when being touched. This gives a hint, if all covers are sealed completely.
        \nWarning: The expected pressure curves have been determined empirical with a sample Sony Xperia Z3 device. It may be different for your phone.
